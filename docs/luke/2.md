Infancy Narrative

### Questions / Notes

1. (1-2) Again, Luke places the events in history. There is scholarly disagreement over the historicity of Luke's claims of when all this happened - see great article "The Census of Quirinius" in the Ignatius Catholic Study Bible.
2. (1-7) Contrast the earthly idea of kingship (proud, earthly power, rich, living in luxury) with the heavenly king (meek, poor, baby, born in a cave or manger, constrained by swaddling clothes).
3. (11) Titles .. Savior -> rescuing man from sin. Christ -> the awaited and promised (OT) Messiah. King -> Descended from David.
4. (13) heavenly host - an army of God's angels.
5. (14) peace - not just absence of conflict but peace rooted in reconciliation with God. "with whom he is pleased" - appears again at Baptism. connection between Baptism and those who are pleasing and at peace with God.
6. (19) Suggests that Mary is either the direct or indirect source of this information - since she alone would know these details.
7. (8-15) The birth of the Lord announced to the humble and lowly occupation of shepherds. See Matthew's account for the gifts of the Magi. Gifts from the kings of the Gentiles.
8. (23) Jesus consecrated as a priest or purchased from the Levites by a redemption price of 5 shekels. [Ex 13:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ex%2013%3A2&version=RSVCE), [Num 18:15-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Num%2018%3A15-16&version=RSVCE)
9. (25) "consolation of Israel" - when many believed that Yahweh would rescue his people from Gentile rule (the Romans) and re-establish the kingdom of David. Simeon's words evoke Isaiah promises: [Is 40:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2040%3A1&version=RSVCE), [Is 52:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2052%3A9&version=RSVCE), [Is 61:2-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2061%3A2-3&version=RSVCE)
