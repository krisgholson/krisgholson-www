2. (3) When was Caiphas high priest in Jerusalem (AD 18-36)? What do facts like this help do for the Gospel?

5. (17) What is the feast of Unleavened Bread? What is the significance of not leavening the bread? [Ex 12:14-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ex%2012%3A14-20&version=RSVCE)
6. (20-25) Compare the response of Judas to the rest of the disciples ... what is the significance of how they address Jesus?
7. (26-29) What miracle during Jesus' ministry prefigured the Eucharist? [See Chapter 14 study notes](https://krisgholson.com/matthew/14)
8. (26-29) How should we interpret Jesus' commands .. "Take, eat; this is my body." and "Drink ... this is my blood"? Is it a meal? Is it a sacrifice? How do we continue to do this "in remembrance" of him?  [1 Cor 10:14-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2010%3A14-16&version=NIV)
9. (26-29) What theologian wrote this about the Eucharist (Lord's Supper)? What was the context? 
    >However, since it is a very perilous matter not to have any certainty concerning this ordinance [the Lord's Supper], knowledge of which is so needful for our salvation, I have thought that it would be a very useful labour to try briefly and yet clearly to extract the chief substance of what it is necessary to know of the matter.
    
    How is certainty and knowledge of the Lord's Supper "so needful for our salvation?"
10. (28) At what other event does Jesus use the word "covenant? What is the new covenant?
11. (30) Why did they sing a hymn?
12. (31-35) Yep - Peter and the other disciples over-estimate their loyalty. Checkout the same account in Luke (Luke 22:31-34) - who and what does Jesus pray for?
