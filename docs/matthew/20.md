# Gospel According to Matthew Bible Study

## Chapter 20

Book Five: Jesus Travels to Judea and Enters Jerusalem, Narrative: Events in Judea and Jesus' Teaching in the Temple

### Questions (from Jeff Cavin led Bible study on the Book of Matthew "The King and His Kingdom")
1. (1-16) This parable continues and further clarifies Jesus’ reply to the disciples’ question in Matthew 19 — “Who then can be saved?” Jesus replies, “Many that are first will be last, and the last first.” Keep in mind when reading Matthew 20:1-16 that this is a parable. It is not something that actually happened, nor is it proposed as a model for labor relations today. Jesus is telling this story to help his disciples understand who will be part of the kingdom of God.  Some notes:
    * start of day - early laborers: 6 am
    * third hour: 9 am
    * sixth hour: noon
    * ninth hour: 3 pm
    * eleventh hour: 5 pm
    * end of day - 6 pm
2. (1-16) What or whom do the following represent?  
    * The vineyard (see [Jeremiah 12:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2012%3A10&version=RSVCE) and [Isaiah 5:1-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%205%3A1-7&version=RSVCE))
    * Harvest time
    * The employer
    * The first group of workers
    * The later groups
3. (1-16) How does this parable illustrate God’s justice and mercy? (other examples of this mercy .. [Luke 15:11-32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2015%3A11-32&version=RSVCE), [Luke 23:39-43](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2023%3A39-43&version=RSVCE))
4. (1-16) What is the parable’s message to Israel?
5. (17-19) Twice already in Matthew’s Gospel we have heard Jesus prophesy his passion. Review [Matthew 16:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2016%3A21&version=RSVCE), [Matthew 17:22-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2017%3A22-23&version=RSVCE). What new information does Jesus give the disciples in Matthew 20:17-19?
6. (20-28) What “cup” is Jesus talking about in Matthew 20:22? ([Ps 75:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%2075%3A8&version=RSVCE), [Is 51:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2051%3A17&version=RSVCE), [Jer 25:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jer%2025%3A15&version=RSVCE), [Matthew 26:39-42](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2026%3A39-42&version=RSVCE))
7. (26-28) How is greatness achieved in God’s kingdom?
