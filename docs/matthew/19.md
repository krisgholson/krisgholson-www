## Chapter 19

Book Five: Jesus Travels to Judea and Enters Jerusalem, Narrative: Events in Judea and Jesus' Teaching in the Temple

### Questions (from Jeff Cavin led Bible study on the Book of Matthew "The King and His Kingdom")
1. (1-2) The action shifts from Galilee in the north to “Judea beyond the Jordan.” Locate this area on a map. Do you remember what this region is associated with? [Matt 3:1-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%203%3A1-6&version=RSVCE)
2. (3) We have seen the Pharisees plotting to kill Jesus since [Matthew 12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2012%3A14&version=RSVCE). Forbidden under their own law from carrying out a death sentence, they will need to find him guilty of breaking Roman law or get him to provoke the secular authorities. In Matthew 19:3, they test Jesus by asking, “Is it lawful to divorce one’s wife for any cause?” What do you think is behind this question? Can you think of any way in which it represents a potentially lethal trap for Jesus? (Hint: Remember the fate of John the Baptist.)
3. (4-9) How does Jesus avoid the trap? What is the next objection of the Pharisees, and how does Jesus handle it?
4. (4-12) According to [Ephesians 5:31-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205%3A31-3&version=RSVCE), what does marriage represent? In Matthew 19:5, Jesus quotes from [Genesis 2:20-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202%3A20-24&version=RSVCE). Read this passage. What was God’s original plan for marriage? Read [Malachi 2:13-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Malachi%202%3A13-16&version=RSVCE). What do these verses say about God in regard to divorce? How does the reaction of the disciples in Matthew 19:10 support teaching that the marriage bond is created by God and cannot be broken except by death?
5. (16-30) Why do you think Jesus responds the way he does when the rich young man asks what good thing he can do to attain eternal life?
6. (16-30) Jesus says the young man has to obey the commandments to “enter life.” For a list of the Ten Commandments, read [Exodus 20:1-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2020%3A1-17&version=RSVCE). Which of the commandments does Jesus omit in the list he gives the young man in Matthew 19:18-19 that pertain to the young man’s situation? Why do you think he omits those at first?
7. (16-30) Why do you think the disciples are astonished at what Jesus says in Matthew 19:23-24? Can you explain Jesus’ reply in Matthew 19:26?
8. (16-30) Peter is quick to note that he and the other disciples have left everything to follow Christ. What will be their reward?
