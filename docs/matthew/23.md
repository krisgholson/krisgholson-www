## Chapter 23

Book Five: Jesus Travels to Judea and Enters Jerusalem, Narrative: Events in Judea and Jesus' Teaching in the Temple

### Questions
1. (2) The scribes and Pharisees did have legitimate teaching authority by virtue of "sitting on Moses' seat". Jesus actually told His disciples to practice and observe what ever they tell you; what seems to be His primary problem with the Pharisees?
2. (5) "Broad phylacteries" and "long fringes" - what are these? [Deut 6:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut%206%3A8&version=RSVCE), [Deut 11:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut%2011%3A18&version=RSVCE), [Numbers 15:38](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2015%3A38&version=RSVCE) What is Jesus' critique about how the Pharisees are using them?
3. (9) Call no man "father" ... is it wrong to call priests "Father"? Is Jesus being hyperbolic or literal here? [Hebrews 12:7-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2012%3A7-11&version=RSVCE), [1 Cor 4:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%204%3A15&version=RSVCE), [Philem 10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philem%2010&version=RSVCE), [Judges 17:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges%2017%3A10&version=RSVCE), [Judges 18:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges%2018%3A19&version=RSVCE) 
4. (13-29) What are the seven woes that Jesus pronounces on the Pharisees? These 7 woes are likely the sevenfold vengeance that God promised Israel if that violated his covenant (see Lev 26 especially [18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lev%2026%3A18&version=RSVCE), [21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lev%2026%3A21&version=RSVCE), [24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lev%2026%3A24&version=RSVCE), [28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lev%2026%3A28&version=RSVCE)). Some scholars say that Jesus is presenting a "covenant lawsuit" against unfaithful Israel and pronouncing the woes as convenant curses agains the impenitent. Compare the woes to the curses listed in [Deut 27:15-26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut%2027%3A15-26&version=RSVCE) which the Levites were to deliver to Israel before crossing the Jordan into the Promised Land. Contrast the woes to the blessings delivered in the Beatitudes. [Matt 5:3-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%205%3A3-12&version=RSVCE)
5. (15) What is a "proselyte"?
6. (16-22) The Pharisees made false and hair-splitting oaths. What did Jesus say about swearing oaths during the Sermon on the Mount? [Matt 5:33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%205%3A33&version=RSVCE)
7. (24) Put Jesus' comment about "straining out a gnat" and "swallowing a camel" in first century Jewish context. [Lev 11:41-43](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lev%2011%3A41-43&version=RSVCE), [Lev 11:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lev%2011%3A4&version=RSVCE). Is Jesus' main issue with the Pharisees that they: strained gnats, tithed small seasoning herbs ([Lev 27:30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lev%2027%3A30&version=RSVCE), [Deut 14:22-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut%2014%3A22-23&version=RSVCE)), and observed the minute laws of God? If those are not His main issues with them, what are? Are their small commands that we get hung up on in our current lives while ignoring justice, mercy, and faith?
8. (27) Why were the tombs whitewashed? [Num 19:11-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Num%2019%3A11-20&version=RSVCE)
9. (34-36) Jesus mentions some past OT righteous victims ([Gen 4:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen%204%3A8&version=RSVCE), [Zech 1:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zech%201%3A1&version=RSVCE)) and alludes to future NT martyrs. BTW, Zecharriah's, son of Barachiah, death is not actually recorded in the OT so Jesus may be drawing from ancient tradition (which you can find in later rabbinic tradition-> [Targum on Lamentations](https://www.sefaria.org/Aramaic_Targum_to_Lamentations.2.20?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en) given that [ Zechari′ah is the son of Berechi′ah is the son of Iddo](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zech%201%3A1&version=RSVCE)) not scripture here. By rejecting God's Messiah, Jesus' generation calls down divine judgement stored up from the ages.
10. (37) Jesus expects but is still saddened by Jerusalem's rejection of Him. See OT examples of God's portrayal as a winged bird protecting Israel ...  [Is 31:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2031%3A5&version=RSVCE), [Deut 32:10-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut%2032%3A10-12&version=RSVCE), [Ps 91:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%2091%3A4&version=RSVCE)
11. (23:38 - 24:3) Jesus walks out of the temple, leaving it forsaken and desolate, and he goes to the Mount of Olives - east of the city. God left the temple in the OT too. [Jer 12:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jer%2012%3A7&version=RSVCE), [Dan 9:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dan%209%3A17&version=RSVCE) Of course, this was all prophesied. [Ezek 10:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezek%2010%3A18&version=RSVCE), [Ezek 11:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezek%2011%3A23&version=RSVCE) What happened after God left the temple in the OT?
