Book Five: Jesus Travels to Judea and Enters Jerusalem, Narrative: Events in Judea and Jesus' Teaching in the Temple

### Questions (from Jeff Cavins led Bible study on the Book of Matthew "The King and His Kingdom")
1. (1-11) To better understand the significance of the way Jesus enters Jerusalem, read [Zechariah 9:9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zechariah%209%3A9-10&version=RSVCE); [1 Kings 1:32-46](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings%201%3A32-46&version=RSVCE); [2 Kings 9:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings%209%3A13&version=RSVCE). With these verses as the background, what does Matthew 21:4-5 say is being fulfilled, and how do you know?
2. (12-13) In Matthew 20:13, Jesus says to those who are changing money and selling pigeons in the Temple: “It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer’; but you make it a den of robbers.” Jesus does not want the Temple profaned by being turned into a marketplace. Read that verse from its original context in [Isaiah 56:6-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2056%3A6-12&version=RSVCE). What else does Jesus indict the Jewish leaders for when he quotes this verse?
3. (18-22) How is what Jesus does to the fig tree in this passage prophetic? (For help with this question, read [Jeremiah 8:5-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%208%3A5-9&version=RSVCE), [Jeremiah 8:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%208%3A13&version=RSVCE); [Hosea 9:10-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea%209%3A10-17&version=RSVCE).) What is the message of this incident for us?
4. (23-27) What challenge does Jesus face from the chief priests and elders? How does Jesus handle their question?
5. (28-32) Jesus tells the leaders two parables. Summarize the message behind the parable of the two sons. What or who do the following represent?  
    * the vineyard
    * the first son
    * the second son
6. (33-41) Summarize the message of the parable of the wicked tenants. What or who do the following represent?  
    * the householder
    * the vineyard
    * the tenants
    * the householder's servants
    * the "other" tenants (41)  
    
   Do the Pharisees understand the meaning behind the parable? To whom is the message of  the parable directed? How do the Pharisees react to this, and what keeps them from overt action against Jesus?
7. (42-45) What message is Jesus trying to send when he refers to [Psalm 118:22-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20118%3A22-23&version=RSVCE)
