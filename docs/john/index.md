## Jesus' Farewell Discourse (John 13:31 - John:17:26)

1. What is the context of Jesus' Farewell Discourse? When does He give it, where is he, and who is present?
1. (13:33) What does Jesus mean when He tells the Apostles, "Where I am going you cannot come." Ever?
1. (13:34) Compare/contrast the new commandment that Jesus gives His Apostles with his summary of the greatest commandment. [Matt 22:36-40](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2022%3A36-40&version=RSVCE)
1. (13:34) What does Jesus mean by "love"? How did Jesus love the Apostles? How do we (or should we) follow this new commandment today?
1. (14: 2-6) "Jesus is the way, and the truth, and the life" - the only way to get to the Father (and Heaven) is through Him. He told His disciples as much earlier in his ministry when he compared Himself to Jacob's Ladder. [John 1:51](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A51&version=RSVCE), [Gen 28:11-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen%2028%3A11-17&version=RSVCE) Read what Jacob says in [Gen 28:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen%2028%3A17&version=RSVCE).Does this provide even more context to Jesus' words that He will prepare a place for them in His Father's house?
1. (14: 8-11) Jesus response to Philip's request doesn't reveal the fullness of the Trinity yet but what did it reveal to the Apostles?
1. (14:12) How do Christians do the works that Jesus does? What are some examples of works greater than Jesus' works that Christians did or continue to do?  Does "greater" mean greater in number or greater in quality? (see ["Greater Works Than These](https://www.catholic.com/magazine/online-edition/greater-works-than-these) for some examples/ideas related to quality, also see [St. Augustines Tract 71](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1701071.htm) - paragraph 3, [St. Augustines Tract 72](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1701072.htm)) Who and what make possible the greater works?
1. (14:13-14) Does Jesus do whatever Christians ask in His name? Is this promise for all Christians or just for the Apostles in the upper room? What does it mean to ask something in His name?
1. (15:1-24) Where do we find Jesus' commandments/words that we must keep? 
1. (15:25-26) What are some examples of the "all things" that the Holy Spirt taught and brought to the remembrance of the Apostles? Does the Holy Spirit continue to teach the Church "all things"? Reflect on this verse in relation to the idea (put forth by Protestant theologian Karl Barth) that the claim that God has spoken implies a Trinity: in God, there is a speaker (the Father), there is a Word spoken (the Son), and an interpreter of the Word (the Holy Spirit).

1. (15:27) Contrast the peace which Jesus gives to the peace which the world gives.
1. (15:1-17) Ponder the metaphor of the true vine and the vinedresser. What is the fruit? What happens to fuitless branches? What might pruning be for the branches that do bear fruit? What does it mean to abide in the vine?
1. (15:18-16:4) Compare Jesus' message here to [Lk 10:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2010%3A16&version=RSVCE).
