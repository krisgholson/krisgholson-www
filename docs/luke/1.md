# Gospel According to Luke Bible Study

## Chapter 1
Infancy Narrative

### Questions / Notes

1. (2) Luke has this on good authority ... "from the beginning were eyewitnesses". Based on the content in Chapter 1 it likely includes the Blessed Virgin Mary. Apostolic tradition.
2. (5) "In the days of Herod" ... this is not just a fable. Luke places this at a point in verifiable history.
3. (5) "Zechariah" === "Yahweh has remembered" (Hebrew), "Elizabeth" === "My God's oath" (Greek form of Hebrew name with that meaning)
4. (8-9) Since most priests were honored to burn incense only once in their lifetime, this was the crowning moment of Zechariah's ministry.
5. (18) Zechariah doubts Gabriel.
6. (26-38) Gabriel foretold the Messiah's coming in the OT and now delivers the message about John and Jesus' coming in the NT. [Dan 9:21-27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dan%209%3A21-27&version=RSVCE)
7. (28) Nowhere else in the Bible does an angel address a person with a title ... "Hail, full of grace". 
8. (31) Jesus === "Yahweh saves" (Hebrew)
9. (32-33) Jesus is the Messiah that has long been foretold. [2 Sam 7:12-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Sam%207%3A12-16&version=RSVCE), [Ps 89:26-29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%2089%3A26-29&version=RSVCE), [Ps 132:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%20132%3A11&version=RSVCE), [Is 9:6-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%209%3A6-7&version=RSVCE) Following Jewish custom, Joseph's legal fatherhood was equivalent to natural fatherhood in matters of inheritance. Thus, Joseph (and likely Mary too) makes Jesus a Davidic descendant.
10. (34) Mary (unlike Zechariah) is not doubting Gabriel, but is asking HOW the plan will unfold since she has made a vow of virginity ("how will this be, since I do not know man"). Her question makes NO sense if she had not already taken a vow of virginity; she knows where babies (usually) come from.
11. (35) The Trinity is referenced here ... "Holy Spirit" ... "power of the Most High" ... "the Son of God". "overshadow you" - this is similar language to how Yahweh overshadowed the Temple in [Ex 40:35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ex%2040%3A35&version=RSVCE) 
12. (38) Mary's fiat - her "yes" to God. She ALWAYS does the will of God and leads us to it when we honor her and look to her example.
13. (39-56) The "Visitation" of Mary to her cousin Elizabeth. Luke is communicating to us that Mary is the NEW Ark of the Covenant. [Mary, Ark of the Covenant](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EpRgKYB9ual0lcUSdaZO3wsf88Qq4Kf8/view?usp=sharing), [Rev 11:19-12:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev%2011%3A19-12%3A2&version=RSVCE)
14. (46-55) The Magnificat. Resembles the Song of Hannah in [1 Sam 2:1-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Sam%202%3A1-10&version=RSVCE). Other OT passages that illumine the background: [Ps 89:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%2089%3A10&version=RSVCE), [Ps 89:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%2089%3A13&version=RSVCE), [Ps 98:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%2098%3A3&version=RSVCE), [Ps 111:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%20111%3A9&version=RSVCE), [Sir 33:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Sir%2033%3A12&version=RSVCE), [Hab 3:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hab%203%3A18&version=RSVCE) 
15. (63) Zechariah no longer doubts but rejoices. Faithful to the message of Gabriel, he names his son "John".
16. (68-79) The Benedictus.  Praises God for his faithfulness to Israel and his careful orchestration of salvation history. (1) establish David's throne forever [2 Sam 7:12-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Sam%207%3A12-16&version=RSVCE), [Ps 89:1-4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%2089%3A1-4&version=RSVCE), [Ps 89:26-37](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%2089%3A26-37&version=RSVCE) and (2) bless all nations through Abraham's descendants [Gen 22:16-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen%2022%3A16-18&version=RSVCE)
