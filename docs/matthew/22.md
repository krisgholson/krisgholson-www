Book Five: Jesus Travels to Judea and Enters Jerusalem, Narrative: Events in Judea and Jesus' Teaching in the Temple

### Questions
1. (1-14) In the parable of the marriage feast, who/what do the following represent?  
    * the king
    * his son
    * the marriage feast [Is 25:6-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2025%3A6-9&version=RSVCE), [Jn 6:53-58](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%206%3A53-58&version=RSVCE), [1 Cor 10:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2010%3A16&version=RSVCE), [Rev 19:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev%2019%3A9&version=RSVCE)   
    * the servants sent to call the invited guests
    * the unworthy invited guests
    * the city burned
    * the later servants sent to invite everyone
    * the later invitees (the bad and good)
    * the wedding garment: [Rev 19:7-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev%2019%3A7-8&version=RSVCE) (righteous deeds of the saints), [Matt 6:2-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%206%3A2-18&version=RSVCE) (almsgiving, prayer, fasting), [Matt 25:34-40](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2025%3A34-40&version=RSVCE) (works of mercy)
    * the man with no wedding garment 
2. (16-18) What would the Pharisees and their disciples think about Roman rule and paying taxes to Caesar? What would the Herodians think about it? Why is the question posed to Jesus a trap?
3. (19-21) What was stamped on the denarius and why would it have been so offensive to devout Jews? [Ex 20:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ex%2020%3A4&version=RSVCE), [That taxing question](https://allenbrowne.blog/2021/01/13/that-taxing-question/)

4. (21) Jesus avoids the trap with a command and a teaching lesson - "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." What "things" belong to God which we are commanded to render to Him? What image is on them? [Gen 1:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen%201%3A27&version=RSVCE)
6. (30) Why are some reasons why marriage not necessary in heaven? Think about the purpose of marriage. 
5. (25) In the story setup by the Sadduccees, why do the 7 brothers all marry the same woman after the prior brother dies? [Deut 25:5-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut%2025%3A5-6&version=RSVCE). This 7 husband scenario may sound far-fetched scenario but may echo the story of Sarah in Tobit [Tob 7:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Tob%207%3A11&version=RSVCE) who had been married 7 times - each husband killed on their wedding night by a demon. 
7. (30) Why is it ironic (and a bit of a burn) that Jesus says that we will be like "angels in heaven" [Acts 23:6-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2023%3A6-8&version=RSVCE)? What does it mean to be "like angels in heaven"? [Is 6:2-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%206%3A2-3&version=RSVCE), [Rev 5:11-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev%205%3A11-12&version=RSVCE)
8. (31) Jesus could have defended resurrection with stronger supporting passages from the OT ([Is 26:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2026%3A19&version=RSVCE), [Dan 12:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dan%2012%3A2&version=RSVCE)) - why did he defend it to the Sadduccees with a passage from the Torah [Ex 3:1-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ex%203%3A1-6&version=RSVCE)? 
9. (40) Jesus distills the heart of the 613 commands of the Mosaic Law (the law and the prophets) into 2 prescriptions: love God ([Deut 6:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut%206%3A5&version=RSVCE)) and love your neighbor ([Lev 19:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lev%2019%3A18&version=RSVCE)). Paul also teaches that love is the greatest theological virtue ([Lev 19:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lev%2019%3A18&version=RSVCE)) and fulfil's God's moral law ([Rom 13:8-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom%2013%3A8-10&version=RSVCE)).
10. (45) Jesus' question concerns the meaning of [Ps 110:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%20110%3A1&version=RSVCE). The Pharisees assume it mentions the Messiah, but their understanding of the verse is partial and inadequate. Psalm 110 is an enthronement psalm that was probably use at coronation ceremonies for Davidic kings. In context, David addresses his son as "my Lord", a title more appropriate for one's superior. This implies that the expected Messiah would be greater than David himself, a crucial point missed by the Pharisees ([Acts 2:34-36](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%202%3A34-36&version=RSVCE)).
