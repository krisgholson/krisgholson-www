Passion Week Narratives: The Suffering and Resurrection of Jesus

### Questions
1. (1) "took counsel" - Matthew's description of the plot alludes to [Ps 2:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%202%3A2&version=RSVCE). (see [Acts 4:25-27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%204%3A25-27&version=RSVCE))
2. (2) Pontius Pilate was the governor of Judaea - he is one of the villians of the Crucifixion and is mentioned by name in all 4 Gospels and is one of only 3 human names listed in both the Apostle's Creed and the Nicene Creed. Why was it so important for the Early Christians to document he and his actions by name?
3. (4) Compare Judas’ remorse in Matthew 27:4 over his sin of “betraying innocent blood” with Peter’s bitter sadness in Matthew 26:75. How do they differ?
4. (8-10) Matthew spends valuable papyrus documenting what was done with the blood money of 30 pieces of silver in order to show that this was all foretold in the OT:  
    a. Jeremiah made a famous visit tp a potter [Jer 18:1-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jer%2018%3A1-11&version=RSVCE) and was commissioned by God to purchase a field [Jer 32:6-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jer%2032%3A6-9&version=RSVCE),  
    b. while Zechariah narrates how the wicked shepherds of Israel valued the Lord at a mere "thirty shekels of silver", a price so worthless it was thrown away to a "potter" [Zech 11:12-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zech%2011%3A12-13&version=RSVCE)  
    
    The wider context of Jeremiah gives these oracles a geographic focus: the prophet also smashed a potter's vessel in the gate overlooking the valley of Hinnom (i.e. Gehenna/Topheth) as a sign that Jerusalem and Judea would be destroyed for shedding innocent blood [Jer 19:1-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jer%2019%3A1-15&version=RSVCE). Ancient tradition locates Judas' burial site (Field of Blood) in the same valley of Hinnom, precisely where Jeremiah smashed the pot and foretold its destiny as a future graveyard [Jer 19:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jer%2019%3A11&version=RSVCE).
5. (11) Where do you think Pilate got the title "King of the Jews" from? Why would *this* title be of interest to Pilate?
6. (16) Why is the name Barrabbas so ironic (and tragic)?
7. (19) Only Matthew records the fact of Pilate's wife's dream .. as in the Infancy Narratives, dreams are channels for divine warning and instruction.
8. (20-23) Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem occurred less than a week before. How did we go from "Hosannah in the Highest" to "Let him be crucified" this quickly?
9. (24-25) Pilate washed his hands and said he was innocent of this *righteous* man's blood. All the people took an oath that Jesus' blood would be on them and their children. Is Pilate innocent of Jesus' death?
10. (25) How was the people's rash oath visited on them later as a curse?
11. (27-30) The scarlet robe, the crown of thorns, the reed in his right hand, the title "King of the Jews" - the soldiers intended all these as mocking of Jesus. We can now recognize these mocking images as announcements of the truth of His kingship. Think way back to the Infancy Narrative .. the Wise Men are the only figures in Matthew to use "King of the Jews" in a positive and honorable way.
12. (33) Golgotha (Aramaic) == Calvariae (Latin)
13. (34) What was Jesus offered to drink? Why did he refuse it?
14. (35) What caused death in Crucifixion? 
15. (35) How is the division of garments a fulfillment of OT prophesy? [Ps 22:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%2022%3A18&version=RSVCE) Where will we see this Psalm alluded to again?
16. (40-42) What did Jesus say about the generation seeking for a sign? [Matt 16:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2016%3A4&version=RSVCE)
17. (45) The phenomenon of the Crucifixion was prophesied too ... [Amos 8:8-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Amos%208%3A8-10&version=RSVCE)
18. (45) The ninth hour is 3pm. Have you ever heard of the [Divine Mercy Prayer](https://divinemercy.life/divine-mercy-3-oclock-prayer/)?  
19. (46) Read all of [Ps 22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%2022&version=RSVCE)
20. (48) Vinegar on a reed - could this be the [4th Cup of the Passover seder meal](https://www.catholic.com/magazine/print-edition/hunt-for-the-fourth-cup)? What is significant about the type of reed used for the vinegar?
21. (51) The curtain of the Temple hung between the Temple's two holiest chambers, the holy place and the most holy place. [Ex 26:31-34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ex%2026%3A31-34&version=RSVCE) The veil was a sign that God's infinite holiness could not be approached by sinners. [Heb 9:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb%209%3A8&version=RSVCE) With Jesus' saving death, forgiveness is secured for man, and access to heaven is reopened. [Eph 2:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Eph%202%3A18&version=RSVCE), [Heb 10:19-22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb%2010%3A19-22&version=RSVCE)  This is announced by God himself, who tears the veil from top to bottom. 
22. (52) WHEN do the raised saints come out of the open tombs? In the Apostle's Creed, what are the events we profess after Jesus was crucified?
23. (55-56) According to Matthew and the other Gospels, which of Jesus' disciples were present at the Crucifixion? 
24. (57-61) Why the specific mention of exactly who was there at the burial of Jesus?
25. (61) Who is "the other Mary"? If not Jesus' mother, could she have still been related to Jesus? [John 19:25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2019%3A25&version=RSVCE)
26. (62-66) Pilate gives the chief priests and Pharisees a guard to secure the tomb - why does Matthew document all of this? What would have been the likely penalty for the guards (assuming they were Roman), if the tomb was robbed?
