What (if anything) does our participation in the Sacrament of the Eucharist DO? 
8. (26-29) What theologian wrote this about the Eucharist (Lord's Supper)? What was the context? 
    >However, since it is a very perilous matter not to have any certainty concerning this ordinance [the Lord's Supper], knowledge of which is so needful for our salvation, I have thought that it would be a very useful labour to try briefly and yet clearly to extract the chief substance of what it is necessary to know of the matter.
