# Gospel According to John Bible Study

## Chapter 13

Some Title



1. (1-12) The coverage of Herod's execution of John the Baptist is a slight flashback in time. Why might Matthew have included the coverage of John's death? And why might he have included it at this point in his Gospel? This episode is followed shortly by Jesus' feeding of the 5000 (13-21). John the Baptist "is Elijah who is to come" (11:14). What OT prophet followed Elijah (after Elijah was taken up to heaven) and had a double share of Elijah's spirit? What are some examples of the miracles that that prophet performed? ([2 Kings 4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings%204&version=RSVCE) and especially note [2 Kings 4:42-44](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings%204%3A42-44&version=RSVCE))
