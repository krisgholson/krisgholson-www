Passion Week Narratives: The Suffering and Resurrection of Jesus

### Questions
#### (Questions below - except #3, #8, #11 - are from Jeff Cavin led Bible study on the Book of Matthew "The King and His Kingdom")
1. (1) What is the significance of Jesus rising on the dawn of the first day of the week after the Sabbath?
2. (1) What is the difference between the Jewish Sabbath and the Christian Sunday? [Rev 1:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev%201%3A10&version=RSVCE)
3. (6) The angel said "He is not here; for he has risen, as he said." When did Jesus say this was going to happen? [Matt 12:40](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2012%3A40&version=RSVCE), [Matt 16:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2016%3A21&version=RSVCE), [Matt 17:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2017%3A9&version=RSVCE), [Matt 17:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2017%3A23&version=RSVCE), [Matt 20:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2020%3A19&version=RSVCE), [Matt 26:32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2026%3A32&version=RSVCE)
4. (9-10) Read St. Paul’s reflections on Jesus’ resurrection in [1 Corinthians 15:12-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015%3A12-24&version=RSVCE). Why is it so important for Jesus to be raised from the dead?
5. (11-15) The elders bribe the guards to lie and say the disciples have stolen Jesus’ body. Is this lie convincing? Why, or why not?
6. (11-15) What are the religious leaders afraid of that prompts them to spread this story?
7. (16-20) Jesus instructs the women to send the disciples to Galilee where they will see him for themselves. It is there that he appears to the disciples to give them the instructions that are often called “the Great Commission” ([Matthew 28:16-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028%3A16-20&version=RSVCE)). Note the relationship of Galilee to Jerusalem on a map. Why would Jesus call his disciples to this location to see him and hear these important instructions? (We kind of covered this back in [Chapter 4 - see question #9](https://krisgholson.com/matthew/4))
8. (17) Why did some of his disciples doubt? [Mark 9:24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%209%3A24&version=RSVCE), [They Doubted](https://media.ascensionpress.com/video/ascension-of-the-lord-fr-mikes-homily/), [They Worshiped, but They Doubted](https://media.ascensionpress.com/2018/05/25/they-worshiped-but-they-doubted/)
9. (19-20) List the things Jesus tells the disciples to “go therefore” and do. [Gal 3:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal%203%3A8&version=RSVCE), [John 14:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A26&version=RSVCE), [John 16:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016%3A13&version=RSVCE), [Gal 3:26-27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal%203%3A26-27&version=RSVCE), [Mat 3:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mat%203%3A11&version=RSVCE)
10. (19-20) Why does Jesus tell them to do this? Read also [Daniel 7:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%207%3A14&version=RSVCE). Do you see a connection?
11. (20) Is the Church still "teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you"? How do we know?  [John 14:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A26&version=RSVCE), [John 16:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016%3A13&version=RSVCE)
12. (20) What comforting promise does Jesus leave with his disciples, and why do they need it?
13. (20) What name of Jesus (a name that Matthew emphasizes in [Matthew Chapter 1 - see study question 11](https://krisgholson.com/matthew/1)) are these words a reminder of?
