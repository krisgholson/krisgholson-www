Book Five: Jesus Travels to Judea and Enters Jerusalem, Discourse: The Olivet Discourse - Judgment on Jerusalem

### Questions
1. (1-8) The question that prompts Jesus' Olivet Discourse is when His disciples privately ask Him when the Temple will be destroyed and what will be the sign of His ["coming" (Greek "Parousia")](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18I5-nEItUGLxDZSNcSOhfbKvNKEY1W0H/view?usp=sharing) and the "close of the age" ... when is the "close of the age"?   

    Commentary from Ignatius Catholic Study Bible: (1) Some read it as a double question about two distinct events: the fall of the Temple and the future return of Jesus. Several proponents contend that Jesus speaks of the first event in 24:4-35 and of the second in 24:36-25:46. (2) Others read it as a single question about a single event and the circumstances surrounding it. For some, the entire discourse concerns the demise of Jerusalem and the Temple; for others, its principle topic is the Second Coming. Either way, the whole of Matthew 24-25 is read as a unified exposition, with 24:36 marking a shift in emphasis rather than a change of subject. In favor of the single-question view, Luke records many of the same statements that span the two parts of Mt 24 (housetop, 24:17; lightning, 24:27; body and eagles, 24:28; Noah, 24:37; women grinding, 24:41) but rearranges them into a different sequence, all referring to a single time of fulfillment (see [Lk 17:22-37](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2017%3A22-37&version=RSVCE)). Luke's presentation thus undermines a division of the discourse into two halves dealing with two different subjects. For the main subject being the Temple's destruction, see essay [End of the World?](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k2K2gWuAgZlYpvYazHNSFSpXZ3o_ZYAJ/view?usp=sharing) **close of the age**: Jewish theology distinguished between "this age" and "the age to come" heralded by the Messiah. Christian theology transposed this traditional schema of the two ages to cover the present age of history, still dominated by sin and evil ([2 Cor 4:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Cor%204%3A4&version=RSVCE), [Gal 1:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal%201%3A4&version=RSVCE)) and the coming age of eternal life in the resurrected state ([Mk 10:30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%2010%3A30&version=RSVCE), [Lk 20:34-36](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2020%3A34-36&version=RSVCE)). Jesus may be said to address the closing of the age at both levels in the following discourse. Not only does he speak of the demolition of the Temple (2), which marks the end of the pre-messianic order of worship ([Jn 4:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%204%3A21&version=RSVCE), [Heb 9:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb%209%3A26&version=RSVCE)), but he also foretells that heaven and earth will pass away (35), thus addressing the end of history as well (as in [Matt 28:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2028%3A20&version=RSVCE)).
2. (8) "the sufferings" -> literally, "the birth pangs". This is an OT prophetic image for grief, which overcomes sinners when God comes to judge ([Is 26:17-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2026%3A17-18&version=RSVCE), [Jer 6:24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jer%206%3A24&version=RSVCE), [Hos 13:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hos%2013%3A13&version=RSVCE)).
3. (9-13) In verse 9, who are the "they" that will deliver the disciples up to tribulation and put them to death? How do the disciples (and we) prevent ourselves from being led astray by false prophets?  Are false prophets the same as heretics? In verse 12, if wickedness multiplying causes mens' love to grow cold, it would seem that the opposite of "wickedness multiplying" would cause men's love to burn hot. What is the opposite of "wickedness multiplying"? What does verse 14, "But he who endures to the end will be saved" mean in practical terms? 
4. (14) We often just shortcut the "gospel of the kingdom" to "the gospel". Jesus specifically calls it "this gospel of the kingdom" .. and that statement follows many warnings that would normally be considered "dire" (not necessarily "good news"). What makes it gospel or "good news"? What makes it a "kingdom"? On November 15, 2024, has the gospel of the kingdom been preached throughout the "whole world"? What is the "whole world"? [Rom 1:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom%201%3A8&version=RSVCE), [Col 1:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Col%201%3A6&version=RSVCE), [Col 1:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Col%201%3A23&version=RSVCE), [1 Thess 1:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thess%201%3A8&version=RSVCE)
5. (15) What was the original "desolating sacrilege spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place"? ([Dan 9:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dan%209%3A27&version=RSVCE), [Dan 11:31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dan%2011%3A31&version=RSVCE), [Dan 12:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dan%2012%3A11&version=RSVCE), [1 Mac 1:31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Mac%201%3A31&version=RSVCE), [1 Mac 1:37](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Mac%201%3A37&version=RSVCE), [1 Mac 1:54](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Mac%201%3A54&version=RSVCE)) What was the later "desolating sacrilege" that prompted early Christians in Judea to flee to the mountains and escape destruction in AD 70? ([An Abomination in the Temple](https://www.ligonier.org/learn/devotionals/abomination-temple), [Lk 21:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2021%3A20&version=RSVCE))
6. (16) Early Christian fled Jerusalem rather than defending the city. Firstly, how did they know that they should leave before it was too late? ([Eusebius Church History, Book III, Chapter 5, Section 3](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm), [Not One Stone Left Upon Another](https://christianhistoryinstitute.org/magazine/article/not-one-stone-left-upon-another#:~:text=(2)%20Eusebius%2C%20the%20%E2%80%9C,the%20Roman%20siege%20and%20conquest.)). Secondly, why was this move wise and not cowardly? ([Zech 14:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zech%2014%3A5&version=RSVCE), [Joel 2:32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joel%202%3A32&version=RSVCE), [Obad 17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Obad%2017&version=RSVCE))
7. (27) What does the simile of lightning tell us about the coming of the Son of Man? ([Ps 97:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%2097%3A4&version=RSVCE), [Is 29:5-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2029%3A5-6&version=RSVCE), [Zech 9:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zech%209%3A14&version=RSVCE), [Parousia Word Study](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18I5-nEItUGLxDZSNcSOhfbKvNKEY1W0H/view?usp=sharing))
8. (28) Who is the "body" and who are the "eagles"? It is interesting that the Roman military standards features eagles as symbols of the empire. Eagle is sometimes translated "vulture" in the OT. ([Deut 28:49](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut%2028%3A49&version=RSVCE), [Hab 1:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hab%201%3A8&version=RSVCE), [Hos 8:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hos%208%3A1&version=RSVCE))
9. (29) What did images of heavenly chaos ("sun ... moon ... stars") signify for kingdoms in the OT? ([Is 13:9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2013%3A9-10&version=RSVCE) - Babylon, [Is 34:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2034%3A4&version=RSVCE) - "all the nations", [Ezek 32:7-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezek%2032%3A7-8&version=RSVCE) - Egypt, [Joel 2:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joel%202%3A10&version=RSVCE), [Joel 2:31-32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joel%202%3A31-32&version=RSVCE) - Jerusalem, [Amos 8:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Amos%208%3A9&version=RSVCE) - Israel)
10. (30-31) Why will all the tribes of the earth mourn when they see the sign of the Son of Man? How did Daniel react to the original vision that these verses allude to? [Dan 7:1-28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dan%207%3A1-28&version=RSVCE)
11. (31) "Angels" - is it heavenly angels here or preachers of the Gospel? (considering that the Greek word _angeloi_ can be translated "messengers" - as it was in [Mt 11:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2011%3A10&version=RSVCE) ) 
12. (31) Trumpet call in Isaiah referred to the restoration of the exiles of Israel [Is 27:12-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2027%3A12-13&version=RSVCE). The gathering in of the elect from the "four winds" (4 corners of the earth) recalls OT passages about the in gathering of God's people from among the nations. ([Deut 30:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut%2030%3A4&version=RSVCE), [Is 11:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2011%3A12&version=RSVCE), [Zech 2:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zech%202%3A6&version=RSVCE))
13. (34-35) OT era gives way to NT era (AD 70). NT era gives way to eternal life at the end of history. [Is 40:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2040%3A8&version=RSVCE), [Is 51:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2051%3A6&version=RSVCE)  
14. (36-44) In Jesus' lesson of the flood (people being swept away) and Jesus' examples of the 2 men in the field and the 2 women grinding at the mill, which people were "taken" and which people were "left"? [2 Pet 2:4-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Pet%202%3A4-10&version=RSVCE)
15. (42-44) "Watch therefore" - a prominent theme in Jesus' teaching. Consider three levels of Christ's glorious coming:  
    * _Past historical_: Disciples having to watch for Christ's judgment on Jerusalem in 70 AD so that they would not be destroyed.
    * _Present liturgical_: Disciples must look with faith to see the coming of Christ in the Eucharist - discerning Jesus' presence in the sacrament to avoid divine judgment [1 Cor 11:27-29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2011%3A27-29&version=RSVCE), [Francis Chan Explains the Eucharist](https://youtu.be/2bH4hpCB2VU?si=OxlXNVBSgzFcSsDl)  
    * _Future eschatalogical_: Disciples must watch for Christ's Second Coming in glory at the end of history. Being vigilant in following Him.
16. (45) What was the task that the master gave to the servant? What does the blessed servant do? What does the wicked servant do?
